I love Hacker News, who doesn't? There's a couple things I thought could come in handy. 

1. A way for me to see if my karma is improving today without having to go back to Hacker News and hit refresh constantly. 
2. I'd like notifications that there are new comments on stories that I've submitted. 

A Google chrome extension seems like a good fit for something like this. 

Right now this does just #1. If you are logged in to Hacker News and load this extension, it will poll Hacker News to get your karma. It will take a baseline of your current karma just once per day and show you the differential (if there is one) as a little "badge" on top of the "Y" icon in your browser extensions bar. 

Coming soon
